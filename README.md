# InstaBot
This Bot can like multiple images. It uses Selenium Webdriver, Beautiful Soup and Chromediver.

You need to have Chrome installed.

Requirements can be found in requirements.txt.

You need to download the right chromedriver.exe for your Chrome. You can find it here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads 

Unpack the folder and copy the chromedriver.exe directly in your project folder.

In run.py you need to change the INFO_IN_CAPS. If you pasted chromedriver.exe like i said the path is just 'chromedriver.exe'.


The Bot will wait some seconds after each action to act more like a human, so be patient if nothing happens in the first second.

If your Internet is very slow you might have to change the wait times manually for now.
